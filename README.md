DS-Algo Questions and Solutions From LeetCode


#### Great Answer to refer while preparation #####

I am not from Tier 1 college (I don't know the categorization basis) and didn't use referrals anywhere. Today, I am a Software Engineer at Amazon. It took me about 3 months of prep to feel really well prepared. I may have been over-prepared because the actual interviews felt super easy when it came down to it. But I'm glad I did. Whether you are a college graduate aiming for any tech-oriented role or an experienced professional who is looking for better opportunities, you might find my experience useful while interviewing with FAANG.


FAANG interviews are binary - either you qualify mostly all or you qualify none. The preparation depends on:

Your understanding of computer science fundamentals - This includes data structures, system design, topics from OS viz. threading, scheduling, memory management; and networking concepts like IP address, DNS, and request-response cycle. If you are interviewing for an HFT, the focus is majorly on OS and networking. { HFT process of interviewing is way too different since different skillset is required. I will write it some other day :) }
Your projects - The projects you do gives direct visibility to your understanding of computer fundamentals.
Practice "regularly" on Leetcode and Logicmojo. If you are not confident in data structures, a course from Logicmojo will help surely if you practice. Once you are confident, start practicing company-wise. The timeline should not be more than 3 months for confident aspirants, and 8 months for new algorithms. If you are taking more than that you are doing injustice to yourself. Sports Programming is NOT required for most FAANGs.

For system design, Logicmojo is the gold standard for preparation. Just reading the content didn't work for me. I practiced system design on a fantastic peer-to-peer interview platform. It has cleared by doubts and also helped in understanding. Many such institute out there. You can check any one of these.

I strongly advise you to get involved in the depth of projects at work. This is relevant to experienced professionals. Depth is required not only for knowledge but for confidence. For undergrads, personal projects help. Don't hesitate to market your work during interviews. If you don't value your work, nobody does.

List of Topics

Below is a list of nearly all of the data structures and algorithms that you can come across during a tech interview along with a very brief description and some resources to get started building your study plan. The goal is to provide a starting point for you to build your plan and not to explain in detail what each topic is. Part of your plan is finding resources to learn more about each topic from different perspectives.

If you haven’t heard of some data structures in the list or haven’t learned much about them before, they might seem complex but as you progress, you’ll soon experience the same feelings you had before and after you understood Arrays.

These data-structures are just the basic building blocks that help you create algorithms… they actually make things simpler once you take the time to understand them. Just as an Array handles a lot of the work required to maintain an ordered list of elements, these data structures have functions and containers for efficiently working with data.

These are considered basic. Everyone should know how they work when to use them, how to implement them, and the reasoning behind their tradeoffs:

Array
Set
Hashmap
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Tree
Graph
If this list seems long, don’t worry. A lot of these data structures are closely related and even build upon each other so you’ll be able to learn them all quicker than you might think.

Hashmaps build upon Arrays. Stacks build upon LinkedList or Arrays. Queues build upon LinkedList. Trees share concepts of “nodes” and “links” from LinkedList. Graphs also share the same concepts. They also have a lot of similarities to trees. All trees are technically graphs too so you can apply a lot of the same techniques to them.

After mastering the basic data structures, knowing these more advanced ones will give you a higher chance of success. Some come up very often during interviews like Heaps and Binary Search Trees. LRU Caches and Tries come up less frequently but are becoming more common. Disjoint Sets and Skip Lists rarely come up, but even if not explicitly asked about them, they can be powerful tools to help you come up with quick and performant solutions.

Heap (a.k.a Priority Queue)
LRU Cache
Binary Search Tree (AVL, Redblack)
Disjoint Set
Trie
Skip List
As we go into more advanced data structures you’ll see they are usually made using the basic ones as building blocks. Getting a good understanding of the basic data structures will make learning these advanced ones much easier. You’ll think of them in terms of the smaller structures you already know rather than big new complicated structures.

Heaps, also known as Priority Queues are a type of tree that behaves like a queue. Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are another type of tree that make it faster to search for nodes. AVL and Redblack are two popular specific types of balanced BSTs. An LRU cache is a memory-efficient cache built by combining a Hashmap with a LinkedList.

A Trie is another type of tree that makes prefix/substring searches fast. Disjoint Sets are a special type of set that separate its members into non-overlapping subsets, useful for the Union Find algorithm. A Skip List is an optimized version of a LinkedList that reduces the time it takes to find certain nodes.

Knowing when you’re ready

You’ll never feel “ready” no matter how long you study. There are always more topics to dive deeper into or weak areas that could use more practice.

There is definitely an element of luck in the whole process. It’s very possible that you get a question on a topic you haven’t prepared for at all or are really weak on. It’s also possible that you get all the questions on topics you’re really strong in since two months ago and didn’t need to spend that extra time studying to pass. You can’t prepare for every possible outcome, but your chances of success get higher than everyone else’s with more practice.

Keeping track of your progress and getting feedback is very important in knowing when you’re truly ready to perform in the real interview without relying on just emotion.

Hope this will be helpful!
